# Project Description
Using existing travel and weather APIs, our application will allow users to make travel plans. Our application will make use of a travel API, Amadeus, to showcase popular destinations and help users to find the best experiences on their adventures. The weather API, Open Weather, will be incorporated as well so users can see the weather expectations of their destinations. Through the application the user will also see budgeting and calendar tools.
